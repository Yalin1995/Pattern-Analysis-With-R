# Pattern Analysis With R

### This course taught by Doctor [Michael Tiefelsdorf](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/tiefelsdorf)

This graduate course focuses on the geo-statistical methodology to [a]
analyze, [b] model and [c] simulate spatial processes. Methods covered
in the course deal with directional, point, lattice, surface and network
data in a multivariate framework by accounting for underlying risk
surfaces and spatial co-variables.
